    <!--Includes a button that when clicked, will toggle the website between day and night themes
        When a user changes the theme, their choice is remembered in localStorage
        The class on the body element is always up-to-date with the current theme (either day-theme or night-theme) â€” you can use document.body.setAttribute('class', 'some-class-name') to set the class on the body
        When the body has the class day-theme, the background of the website is light-colored, with a darker color for the text
        When the body has the class night-theme, the background of the website is a very dark color, with a lighter color for the text
        Somewhere on the page, the user is told how many times they've visited the website (starting with 1 the first time)-->
